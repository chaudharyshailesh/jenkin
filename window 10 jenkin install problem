When installing a service to run under a domain user account, the account must have the right to logon as a service. This logon permission applies strictly to the local computer and must be granted in the Local Security Policy.

Perform the following to edit the Local Security Policy of the computer you want to define the ‘logon as a service’ permission:

Logon to the computer with administrative privileges.
Open the Administrative Tools and open the Local Security Policy
If the Local Security Policy is missing in your system, refer to the answer in the Where to download GPEdit.msc for Windows 10 Home? question on Microsoft Community to troubleshoot
Expand Local Policy [Note: it's ... Policies on Win Server] and click on User Rights Assignment
In the right pane, right-click Log on as a service and select properties.
Click on the Add User or Group… button to add the new user.
In the Select Users or Groups dialogue, find the user you wish to enter and click OK
Click OK in the Log on as a service Properties to save changes.
Then try again with the added user.
